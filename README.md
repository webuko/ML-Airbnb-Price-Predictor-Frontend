# Getting Started
## Backend

In order to get the app working as intendet, the backend is needed. The backend serves the purpose of building an API for retrieving data related to Airbnb listings. In the following, the data source, the involved frameworks and the API (for a detailed usage description, please have a look at this [repository's wiki](https://github.com/webuko/backend/wiki)) are presented. 

Since the project can be used by docker, the set-up is easy. 
Follow the instructions on the backend repository to get the app running:
